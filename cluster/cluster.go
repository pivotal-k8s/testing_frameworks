//
// This package aims to provide a consistent abstraction over a number
// of different ways of creating kubernetes clusters for testing.
//
// To make your test cluster compatible with this framework, just
// implement the Fixture interface.  If you require more config
// options than we have so far, add them to the Config struct. Bear in
// mind while doing so that we aim to maintain compatibility with
// kubeadm, so if your new config options describe properties that
// already exist in the kubeadm config, you should use
// kubeadm-compatibile terminology.

	// cluster fails to start, return an error.
	//
	// This should block until the test cluster control plane is
	// ready to recieve client connections.
